# --- WebAssembly (surface 5, ADR 0017) ------------------------------------------------------------
# A module is compiled code around text: the names it imports and exports, its custom sections
# (each a name and bytes: "name", "producers", "sourceMappingURL", "target_features" or any other)
# and its data segments, active or passive, where a compiled program keeps its string literals.
# read_wasm walks the binary format by its declared lengths and writes each of those as a line of
# text. Control bytes (0x00-0x1f and 0x7f) become line breaks, so each string stands alone; bytes
# from 0x80 stay, so a UTF-8 name reads whole. Every other section (types, functions, tables,
# memories, tags, globals, start, elements, the data count and the code) is stepped over by its
# length. Anything the reader does not expect cannot prove clean: a version other than 1, a section
# it does not know, or out of order, or twice; a length past the end of its section or of the file;
# a LEB128 cut short, or longer than its type allows; an import, export, segment or offset of a
# kind it does not know; bytes left over at the end of a section; or a module past either cap.
#
# Why bash and od, not a parser in another language: every mode already runs on them (the canary
# is made with od), and nothing else the hooks and CI all have can read bytes. jq reads only JSON;
# node is optional for the pre-commit hook and not set up in the firewall job; python is not on
# every Mac. od prints a window of the file as hex pairs into an array; text goes back out through
# printf's \x escapes, and a long run is copied by dd from its own offset, so no byte is ever held
# in a shell variable as itself, and no run costs more than its own length.
#
# Why the caps: bash spends microseconds on every string and on every byte of a short one, so a
# module of many small strings reads at about 11 s per MiB (ADR 0017). The caps bound one read to
# about 90 s at worst, well inside the firewall job's timeout, and past them the run exits 2
# instead of timing out. vroom.wasm is 919,927 bytes and 1,145 strings. A real module past either
# cap raises it, with an ADR.
